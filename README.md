# Java_AudioFun

This is a Java project made in NetBeans that does the following with an audio recording that says "this is a test":
<pre>
play() - Plays each word with a parameter-specified pause between each word
playRandomOrder() - Plays the words in random order
playRandomUnique() - Plays the words in random order, playing each word only once
playReverseOrder() - Plays the words backwards, so this .wav file will say "test a is this"
</pre>  

### To do before running code:
<pre>
1. Make sure you have MediaCompClasses in your libraries
2. Download mediasources folder
3. Change line 25 in the main method to reflect your mediasources folder location
</pre>
